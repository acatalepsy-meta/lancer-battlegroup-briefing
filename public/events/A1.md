# UCS BATTLEGROUP PALLADIUM, DAWNLINE SHORE, BLINK-1 // 6.26.5021u
With the destruction of the **HARRISON ARMORY** orbital manufacturing station **MAQUINERA** over **DS1- HARRISON'S WORLD**, the battle for the Dawnline Shore has entered a bitter stalemate.

In control of the only local Blinkspace Gate, **BLINK-1**, the **UNION NAVY** has taken the breathing room provided by the battle at DS-1 to reorganize their blockade of the Dawnline Shore.

However, attempting containment on an area of space so large is impossible. Recent reports have shown that highly dangerous paracausal weapons of some kind have breached the blockade, and are travelling towards **DS2 -ARKADY II**.

By order of Vice-Admiral Noe Estienne, commanding officer of Union assets in the current area, **CRISIS RESPONSE GROUP MJOLNIR** has been sent to intercept and destroy these weapons.
