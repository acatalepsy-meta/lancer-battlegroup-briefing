# MSMC TRANSPORT CARRIER D132 // 5.24.5021U 3:15 UTC
An experimental ship created by **SSC**â€™s biowarfare division has crash landed while transiting through a minor border system  on the planet **DORADA**. You are new recruits of Mirrorsmoke Mercenary Company, and have been put together under a Commanding Officer operating as your handler, Callsign **STARLINER**. You are **MECHANIZED CHASSIS** (**MECH**) pilots, also known as **LANCERS** and your mechs are the only ones currently able to deploy, as all other pilots on board are still in cryosleep, with a days long decanting process before they would be combat capable.

Your ship is the only one close enough to reach the ruins of the SSC vessel before local subversive elements may have a chance to recover high level **CORPSEC** research material. The damage they could do with that kind of tech is incalculable. Local bandit/raider group **DESERT TIGER** is known to have a hidden base on **DORADA**. Your instructions are to prevent any **SSC** research material from falling into unapproved hands by any means necessary. Retrieval of goods, if at all possible, is a secondary priority. If they cannot be retrieved, they are to be eliminated.

The distress call also mentioned an **NHP** casket going into cascade shortly after the explosion which disabled the ship. The casket should have survived the crash, and recovering it is your primary goal on this mission.
