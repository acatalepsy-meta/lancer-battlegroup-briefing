# Mission // #001
## Find and Retrieve
# Goals
- Discover the location of the crashed NHP casket
- Neutralize any local raiders who are also seeking the casket. **INTELCOM** suspects the Desert Tiger raider group is in the vicinity, supported by its leader Codename **“KHAN”**.

# Stakes
- Time is critical. If the Raiders access the casket first, they could destroy or suborn the NHP, and with access to this research they may be able to access ontolgical weapons and gain great power, allowing them to destroy or otherwise threaten nearby settlements or the Blink Gate itself. Final potential threat level is unknown, equipment is classified **CORPROSEC ULTRA:BLACK**.

# Reserves
- None at this time.
